    <h1>Beware of phishing atttacks!!!</h1>
    <hr>
    <p><strong>What you just clicked on was not a reload button.</strong> I created a fake "no internet" webpage in about 5 minutes,
    and then replaced some key code to redirect to my own website.<br><br>
    BEWARE! This is one of many methods which malicious attackers can use as phishing attacks, or acting under a false identity to trick
    a user to click a link and expose their information.<br>
    Phishing attacks can expose yourself in multiple ways:
    <ul>
      <li>Exposing your IP, web browser, operating system</li>
      <li>Storing and tracking yourself via cookies and internal databases</li>
    </ul>
  <h1>TODO: Complete this information page about phishing attacks.</h1>
