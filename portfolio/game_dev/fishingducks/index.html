				<p>Fishing Ducks is a calm singleplayer/multiplayer game made for the Epic Games Mega Jam 2022 under the
					theme "As Above So Below".
					The game was made in collaboration with <a href="http://ameliaherbert.com">Amelia Herbert</a>, who
					produced the models and textures of the fish and ducks, created the UI styles, and sourced
					some other assets. In the final version of the game, you can choose to play as a fish or a duck,
					competing with the opposing animal to collect points in under 3 minutes.
					To collect points, both animals can collect collectibles that randomly spawn in the map, while fish
					can also perform jumps out of the water, and ducks can try to hit fish by diving.
					The fish and ducks also receive point multipliers depending on if they're diving for ducks, speed
					boosting for fish, or are in some other unique scenario. As mentioned, the game is both singleplayer
					and multiplayer.
					However, due to time and resource constraints, multiplayer is not entirely tested (games can be made
					but I never managed to get anyone to join; you're welcome to try yourself however) and in
					singleplayer you can only play as a duck (this was fixed 30 minutes after the jam ended).
					Once the game ends, scores are shown and a new game starts 1 minute after.
