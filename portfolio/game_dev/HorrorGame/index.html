        <p>This horror game started out not as a horror game, but rather a Unity js game made for the original version
          of this very website. The objective was to collect coins around the map and avoid cubes that gradually got
          closer and sped up towards you. From within the webite, the coins collected would be tracked.<br><br>
          Recently, I was messing around with the original project to see if it still works. I decided to mess around
          with the map's lighting, as well as add some lights on the cubes and coins, and noticed the game had a very
          different feel to it- the floating and approaching cubes seemed scary as a looming threat, especially with
          some omnious red lighting in a dark forest.<br><br>
          With that, I went on and further improved the setting within Unity, reworked the cube's movement a bit, and
          made a way for coins to respawn. I used lighting and colors to guide the player to explore the map, with green
          being the collectibles the player needs to collect, and red being the enemy the player needs to avoid. I think
          the result creates a fundamental horror video game, where the horror isn't always a jumpscare, or gore, but
          rather a looming threat that will eventually creep up behind or in front of you.</p>
