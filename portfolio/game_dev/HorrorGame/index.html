        <div style="flex: 1;padding:2.5%;"><p>This horror game started out not as a horror game, but rather a Unity js game made for the original version of this very website. The objective was to collect coins around the map and avoid cubes that gradually got closer and sped up towards you. From within the webite, the coins collected would be tracked.<br><br>
        Recently, I was messing around with the original project to see if it still works. I decided to mess around with the map's lighting, as well as add some lights on the cubes and coins, and noticed the game had a very different feel to it- the floating and approaching cubes seemed scary as a looming threat, especially with some omnious red lighting in a dark forest.<br><br>
        With that, I went on and further improved the setting within Unity, reworked the cube's movement a bit, and made a way for coins to respawn. I used lighting and colors to guide the player to explore the map, with green being the collectibles the player needs to collect, and red being the enemy the player needs to avoid. I think the result creates a fundamental horror video game, where the horror isn't always a jumpscare, or gore, but rather a looming threat that will eventually creep up behind or in front of you.</p></div>
