				<p>Space Bar Defender is my solo submission for the 2021 Epic Games Megajam, with the theme "Running out
					of Space". The theme
					may typically imply "space" as in physical room in an environment, or storage within a computer,
					container, etc., or outer space.
					I chose to explore the idea of "running out of space" as in running out of the spacebar on a
					keyboard. My idea was to limit the user
					to a single key for the entire game- the spacebar- where they would have a limited amount of time
					which the key can be pressed down.
					<br><br>
					After the game jam I have chosen to continue working on the game, including implementing an infinite
					waves mode, and porting it to Android.
					The game is now currently available on Google Play, playable similar to the PC version but using the
					screen instead of the spacebar.
					<br><br>
					To take this idea into a game, I chose to create an outer space-themed linear tower defense game.
					The player is given a number of turrets
					and a lane of slots to place said turrets, to defend their homeworld from incoming aliens. When
					holding the spacebar, the next available turret moves down
					the lane of slots, highlighting slots which the turretb can be placed in. Upon releasing the
					spacebar, the turret will settle down in the
					highlighted slot, unless it is already occupied by another turret, or a "squatter" enemy. When all
					turrets are placed, a wave of aliens
					travel in front of the lane, getting damaged by each turret. Upon reaching the end of the lane, the
					aliens will invade the planet, reducing the
					level of "The Space Bar," which acts as the health of the planet, as well as a meter for usage of
					the spacebar key. During a wave, the player can
					also activate the "Super Space Laser" by mashing the spacebar, which will fire a powerful laser
					beam, at the cost of The Space Bar's health.
