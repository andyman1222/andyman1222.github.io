        <div style="flex: 1;padding:2.5%;"><p>"Enter a mystic and relaxing world, filled with shiny rolling hills, flashing and shimmering living cubes, and other secrets across the landscape.
          <br><br>
          Travel between 10 unique mazes with varying difficulty and mechanics, collecting items such as cubes and ammunition, to help you get past a wall, up to a higher ground, or find a hidden trophy, solving unique mazes filled with hidden secrets.
          <br><br>
          Expand your collection of unique trophies as you discover hidden items and achievements across the levels. And with most achievements comes a unique skin to customize your own unique gameplay experience."
        <br><a href="https://quantumquantonium.itch.io/amazeing">(itch.io website for Amazeing)</a><br><br>
      Amazeing is my first large indie game project, developed in Unreal Engine. The final game will feature 10 unique mazes containing various secrets and puzzles to solve. The basics of gameplay is to find ammo on the map, which you can shoot at objects to pick up or destroy, and then progress in the maze.<br><br>
      Another big emphasis on the game is going to be the setting. I have created an "above the clouds" world featuring mystic floating cubes and glowing plants along a reflective landscape in the fog. Troubling the world are to-be-named invaders, which fly around the map, slowly consuming the environment as the player progresses through levels.
      <br><br>The game is entirely made by myself, with the exception of some assets used with permission from the Unreal Engine marketplace. I am working on creating a dynamic soundtrack in the game, where the music would change as the player progresses in a single level. I have constructed various materials to expand on the setting ingame, as well as provide visual queues to assist the player. I also made an easy and intuitive UI, which provides the player with options and information within the game.<br><br>
    For more curious players, each level will hold many secrets and challenges, mainly hidden collectible trophies and per-level achievements. By earning achievements, the player can unlock customizations in the main menu for their ammo, the shots their gun fires, and more. By earning all the achievements, the player will unlock a spectator mode.<br><br></p></div>
