					<p>LaserTag is a first person multiplayer shooter designed around the experience of laser tag in
						real life. Developed in
						Unreal Engine 4, the game will feature a sci-fi, computer simulation-style theme. The most
						common gameplay in real life
						laser tag is free-for-all, where people run around in an indoor arena for a few minutes,
						shooting lasers at each other to
						earn points. In the video game LaserTag, there will be different gamemodes and customizaiotn
						settings to enhance the experience.
						Currently, there is one test map and an extensive system to allow for free-for-all or team vs.
						team gameplay, with the ability
						to customize gameplay settings such as team color, time play, and laser recharge time.<br><br>
						Unlike most FPS, LaserTag does not feature a respawning system. Instead, when a player "tags"
						another player, the tagged
						player is set to a tagged state, where they cannot shoot or be hit, but do have increased speed,
						only for a few seconds.
						In addition, players can only be tagged if a laser hits a target on the player's body. There's a
						target on the front and back,
						shoulders, and on the gun, each varying in the number of points gained by tagging the target,
						and the head is not a target.
						The guns in the game shoot lasers, which can be reflected, bent, or duplicated off the walls by
						mirrors or warped glass.<br><br>
						Once the game is complete, there will be a multitude of customization for the game. Players will
						be able to select their
						own laser color and sound, change their character's appearance, and create custom games with
						multiple teams and other settings.
						In addition, I intend to have an AI system that can provide gameplay if the player is playing
						alone.
