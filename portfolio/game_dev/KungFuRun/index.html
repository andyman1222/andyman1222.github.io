        <div style="flex: 1;padding:2.5%;"><p>Kung-Fu Run is the name of the game I worked along with three other people in Unity, for a game development class in spring of 2020. In 10 weeks, we made a game based off a game proposal(?) from a previous class.
          The proposed game was a 3D platformer with a unique storyline, market elements, and a multiplayer. Our end product was five detailed 3D platforming levels based around the Chinese theme. The levels featured various parkouring obstacles to overcome.<br><br>
          We each worked on various different elements of the game, and also used a couple of 3rd party assets to get the game to where we wanted it by the 10th week. I worked heavily on camera and lighting, as well as a few other tweaks and improvements throughout. After someone would make the level, I would go thru it, tweaking lighting, adding some light sources and camera filters to show the time of day and give the game a sense of ancient Chinese ink art style.
          I also improved the overall layout of the levels, fixing some areas that would clip outside the intended map, scaling map assets down to be more at-scale with the player, and adjusting the platforming elements to make the levels challenging and to add secrets. There were many other tweaks I worked on, including the in-game UI which displays coins collected on-screen, creating a UI and font standard for the game, and applying a ragdoll to the character. Although the final product does look great and play well, there's still many bugs and glitches that could be fixed, and the game has plenty of room to expand.
