		<h1>Other games</h1>
		<hr>
		<p>This is a collection of other miscellaneous games or projects in Unity, Unreal Engine, or another game
			engine.
			They are not complete, in fact some of it was just messing around in the engine. These are for games made in
			an
			engine only; I have some Java/C++ games programmed with basic 2D graphics or ASCII, viewable on <a
				href="https://github.com/andyman1222">my github page.</a></p>

				<h2>Horror game</h2><br><br>
				<div style="width: 100%; padding-top:56.25%;position: relative;"><iframe
					style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;" width="100%" height="100%"

			<div style="flex: 1;padding:2.5%;">
				<p>This horror game started out not as a horror game, but rather a Unity js game made for the original
					version
					of this very website. The objective was to collect coins around the map and avoid cubes that
					gradually got
					closer and sped up towards you. From within the webite, the coins collected would be
					tracked.<br><br>
					Recently, I was messing around with the original project to see if it still works. I decided to mess
					around
					with the map's lighting, as well as add some lights on the cubes and coins, and noticed the game had
					a very
					different feel to it- the floating and approaching cubes seemed scary as a looming threat,
					especially with
					some omnious red lighting in a dark forest.<br><br>
					With that, I went on and further improved the setting within Unity, reworked the cube's movement a
					bit, and
					made a way for coins to respawn. I used lighting and colors to guide the player to explore the map,
					with green
					being the collectibles the player needs to collect, and red being the enemy the player needs to
					avoid. I think
					the result creates a fundamental horror video game, where the horror isn't always a jumpscare, or
					gore, but
					rather a looming threat that will eventually creep up behind or in front of you.</p>

			</div>
			<div style="flex: 1;padding:2.5%;">
				<p>"Get Over It In VR" is an experimental VR game I was testing to make in Unreal Engine 4. Based off
					the
					popular game "Getting Over It," "Get Over It In VR" puts the player in a pot and requires them to
					navigate
					by
					pushing a hammer against the ground.<br><br>
					The game is only a concept, as I'm not entirely sure how to accomplish the physics of the hammer to
					realisticly move the player around (for example, to cling on a cliffside). However, I may change the
					game in
					the future to experiment with other gameplay mechanics only capable in VR.<br><br>However, due to
					moving
					away
					to college, I have been unable to work effectively on the game, or anything similar in VR. </p>

			<div style="flex: 1;padding:2.5%;">
				<p>"Maze Game" was my first Unreal Engine project, made over 8 years ago, before Unreal Engine 4 was
					even made
					free to use. The game was the inspiration for <a href="../Amazeing">Amazeing</a>. The simple concept
					of this
					game was to solve a maze by collecting ammunition, which can be shot at to unblock obstacles
					(Amazeing uses
					this same concept and builds on it). The game was made in the course of a week-long summer camp
					about UE4.
					You
					can download the original game's source on Github.</p>

			<div style="flex: 1;padding:2.5%;">
				<p>This airplane dodging game was a prototype I made while messing around with Unity's airplane starter
					pack.
					The game consists of a large, flat indoor area with trees scattered throughout, and a ceiling
					preventing the
					player from flying out. Ideally, what the player must do is fly as long and as fast as possible in
					an
					airplane
					in this space. The trees stood as obstacles which could slow, change the direction of, or even stop
					the
					player. However, there is no game end or finish programmed in, and there's a single UI element that
					doesn't
					even work properly.</p>

			</div>
			<div style="flex: 1;padding:2.5%;">
				<p>I have made two different little prototypes for flight simulation. The first and more recent one, I
					have
					attempted to create a flight simulator using Unreal Engine's physics system. However, there are some
					forces
					or
					aspects of flight which I did not account for in UE4, and there's some bugginess with how I
					implemented the
					wheels, so the makeshift airplane does not yet fly. In the future I might go back and continue work
					on
					this.<br><br>
					The second flight prototype was something made in Unity. Using the starter pack flight scripts from
					Unity
					(the
					same ones used in "Airplane dodging game"), I created 5 player-controlled jets, and a bunch of
					AI-controlled
					jets, in sort of a dogfight. The interesting thing about this is that the player controls 5
					independent
					aircraft, which they can use to fly in formations, or mess up in doing so. The AI aircraft also
					follow the
					main jet, adding some challenge to keep formation from crashing. The player can also switch views
					between
					their controllable aircraft with the number keys.</p>

				<h2>TimeStryke</h2><br><br>
			</div>
			<div style="flex: 1;padding:2.5%;">
				<p>TimeStryke was a project originally led by me some four years ago with my friends. We wanted to make
					a
					simple
					and interesting game, so we went with a 2D MMO similar to "Realm Of the Mad God." The game's
					prominent
					feature
					was that the maps would progress thru time- before, during, and after modern day. Multiple assets,
					code, and
					a
					complex game design document, including plans for PvP and even a story, were made, and in addition
					to
					management, I worked on making a server. However, over time we parted ways and the project is
					extremely
					unfinished.<br><br>
					As a group was working on this game, I do not take credit for the art made in the game. Furthermore,
					the
					game
					is currently in an unplayable state, so as of now I am unable to provide a gameplay demonstration.
