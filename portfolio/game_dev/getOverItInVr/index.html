        <p>"Get Over It In VR" is an experimental VR game I was testing to make in Unreal Engine 4. Based off the
          popular game "Getting Over It," "Get Over It In VR" puts the player in a pot and requires them to navigate by
          pushing a hammer against the ground.<br><br>
          The game is only a concept, as I'm not entirely sure how to accomplish the physics of the hammer to
          realisticly move the player around (for example, to cling on a cliffside). However, I may change the game in
          the future to experiment with other gameplay mechanics only capable in VR.<br><br>However, due to moving away
          to college, I have been unable to work effectively on the game, or anything similar in VR. </p>
