        <p>"Betaa" (name pending) is a multiplayer fps game I was developing before dedicating time to Amazeing. The end goal is to make a first person shooter similar to other class-based shooters like Overwatch and Team Fortress 2, and combine it with fast-paced and fluid movement similar to the Tribes or Titanfall series, and also implement a variety of different modes, including a fast-paced battle royale mode.

          <br><br>Right now, the game is still in early stages of development. Before moving to work on Amazeing, I was working on creating some character classes/weapons, as well as implementing basic multiplayer. I have also been working on a few map concepts.
          <br><br>The prominent map I've been making is "Shattered Edge," a map divided by a reflective plane in the sky and a lake at the bottom, which players can hop on to gain advantages. I have also been considering a chess-based map, where giant chess pieces would move about the board based on how the match progresses. I also have been testing out a map with two different skyboxes/environments, and an underground cave map.
          <br><br>For character classes, I have been implementing some basic weapons and abilities. One character is a basic hitscan sniper, who can scope in and hit targets across the map. One character can fire a volley of homing rockets, which are tracked via the player's crosshair. Another character also fires rockets, except these fire in a straight arc, but when shot the player's speed is added to their initial velocity. The last character I have so far is someone who can rapidly build cubes to block shots or create paths to walk on. All characters will have a gliding mechanism which can be used to greatly increase the player's speed and let them traverse steep inclines, and bunny hopping and at least a triple jump.
          <br><br>As stated before, I have slowed development on this game to work on <a href="../Amazeing/">Amazeing</a>. In comparison to Amazeing, this game is much more ambitious and would take a lot more resources to develop into a fun game. In addition to fully implementing multiplayer, I would have to develop more unique characters, weapons, models, maps, and much more to get the game out. In the future I want to continue full development on this game, perhaps with a team of other game designers to help out.
