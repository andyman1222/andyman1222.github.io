                <p>I designed this base for speakers a sibling has. The speakers came with their own base, but they were
                    some cheap water fountain speakers that had sound issues like static, and in general didn't sound
                    great. I decided to 3D model and print this new base, using dimensions from the new speaker drivers
                    and the original circuitry and fountain tech. There were issues of incorrect sizing and
                    underestimating the amount of platic used to print while trying to make the new bases, but once it
                    all got working the sound did improve and the speakers looked cooler than before.</p>
