				<p>This is a WIP demo of an action game. My intention is to make a through level for such a game,
					with high action and easy to learn gameplay, and develop and build a through world. Right now,
					I have created the start of the level, some of the surrounding environment, a triggerable heat
					vision effect, a triggered event (a flying car passes by once the player gets far enough),
					and a smooth movement system.<br><br>
					The technical art aspects seen in this gameplay includes various postprocessing vfx (the scoped mode),
					glowing neon materials, fog, lighting, and animated materials to mimic a busy city at night, and simple
					physical animations triggered by the player's position. Static textures and models are 3rd party.<br><br>
					When this level is complete, I intend it to have an introduction,
					showing the player a holographic minimap of where they need to go, an AI system that isn't
					difficult but is enough to keep the player going, and other scripted events, such as an assistant
					highlighting targets to eliminate, as well as on-screen HUD elements. To build the level and
					environment, I will use some free assets from the Unreal Engine marketplace. While there is still
					a lot of work to do to build the level, I have drawn out some level plans, giving indication on
					how the level will progress.
