<h1>Source Code to my website!!!</h1>
<hr>
<h2>What is this?</h2>
This is my website, <a href="http://andyherbert254.ddns.net">andyherbert254.ddns.net</a> or <a href="http://quantumquantonium.ddns.net">quantumquantonium.ddns.net</a>. This is my personal website that I am working on myself. Because I'm a good person, I decided to upload the source code for it!
<hr>
<h2>What can I do with this?</h2>
Theroretically, whatever you want! If you do want to use it, <strong>Please cite it as my work!!!!</strong> Like, "This code was originally AndyMan1222's code," or something similar.

<h2>This can't be your entire website, can it?</h2>
Well, it is not everything. You can look at the .gitignore to see what I removed. For cleanliness and security, I did not include .htaccess, .htpasswd, and many, many screenshots I have in images_and_videos/screenshots.
<h1>Enjoy!</h1>
