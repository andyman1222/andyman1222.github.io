        The app "Camera Doodler" and "Camera Doodler Free" do not store, share, or transfer any information whatsoever from its consumers, outside of the consumer's own device. The app has the ability to take pictures and save user-created photos to the local device storage only. The only data tranferred is either as direct result of the consumer sharing saved photos from device storage at their own means, or over bluetooth to communicate with another device running the same app.<br><br>12/17/2019 Andrew Herbert.
