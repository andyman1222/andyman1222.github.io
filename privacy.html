    <h1>Privacy Policy and Terms of Service Agreement</h1>
    <pre>
        This policy is aimed toward paranoid (jk, don't take that seriously, but take the rest of this seriously)... This is aimed towards people concerned about their privacy with my products, servers, and videos, or for those who wish to use my products for their own purpose.

        PRIVACY AND TERMS OF SERVICE

        I. Definition of Terms
            a. Name of the owner of the agreement
                i. The term "name" in section I.a of this document includes the terms "username"
                ii. The official name of the owner of the license agreement, and whatever products it refers to, unless explicitly specified with the product, is "AndyMan1222". "AndyMan1222"" and "AndyHerbert254"" refer to the same persons. "Quantum Quantonium", and variants of the name, are considered as a separate entity to "AndyMan1222"" yet refer to the same agreement unless explicity specified.
                    1. Variants of "Quantum Quantonium" include, but are not limited to, "Quantum Quanton" and "Quantum Quantonum". Variants of the name would normally begin with the word "Quantum" and contain the word "Quantonium", possibly with one or more of its characters removed or modified in order to fit with third-party naming limits, while still resembling the orignal word.
                    2. The name "Andycman" is the same entity as "AndyMan1222". "Andycman" is not a name that is currently in use.
                iii. The term "owner" refers to any and all "names" mentioned under I.a.ii, including all sub-sections.a
