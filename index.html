    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <p style="font-size:.8em;">Welcome to my website! I am Andy Herbert, a CS major at University of Utah.
      This is my website. It has been maintained since 2015, and started as a website for an intro to programming class
      in high school. You may see me as "Quantum Quantonium" if you stumbled upon my Youtube or Twitch channels.<br><br>
    </p><h2 style="font-size: 1.25em;">Here, you will find all sorts of interesting stuff:</h2>
    <ul style="font-size: .75em;">
      <li>On the left (desktop only), you will find a link to my resume, as well as links to my gaming and non-gaming
        Youtube channels. Both have interesting and also dumb content to enjoy as you might (or might not). In short, I
        have done all the video editing on those videos.</li>
      <li>On the right (desktop only), you will find other links of interest, mainly various social and professional
        profiles.
      </li>
      <li>Up top, you will find buttons to go back to this page, view some old JS stuff I made for this website, a
        complete sitemap, and images/videos that I used to keep uploaded.
        <ul>
          <li>Some of the stuff on these pages is old and might no longer be working.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>This is a new homepage for my website. The original homepage, a blog which I have made from scratch, can be
        viewed here: <a href="https://andyherbert.net/blog-archive.php">Click me!</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p><br>
      Please, enjoy my website!!!
